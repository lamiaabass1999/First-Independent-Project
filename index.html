  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Im a student at the University of Leeds studing Economics.
  I decided to take a break from my studies and figure out what i enjoy.
  Before joining Moringa School i was working at an insurtech startup.
  This experience definately had an impact on me choosing to study coding
  Moringa Schhol. As soon as I discvoerd my intrest for coding I decided to persue it.</p>
